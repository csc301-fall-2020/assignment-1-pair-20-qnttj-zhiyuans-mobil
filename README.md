Java
Kotlin
React Native

Ease of development
I have learned Java a year ago and keep practicing with it, especially for the Android app development. However, I am not familiar with Kotlin and React Native and it going to take me a considerable amount of time to develop an Android with one of them.

Maturity and UI library
For Kotlin, many developers use it for the mobiles apps nowadays, such as EverNote, Uber, Coursera and Square. Then for Java, Twitter, Cash App and Signal are examples. For React Native, it is used for the Facebook, Walmart and Instagram mobile app development. Meanwhile, Java and Kotlin are the two official language for the Android app development and Android provides a variety of pre-built UI components and modules for these two language. Though React Native has an amount of incredible UI library, in my opinion, they are not as convenient as others’.

Time cost for Development
React Native can build app faster as it saves time for recompiling the code, which can not be done in Java and Kotlin. Also, the mobile app programmed in React Native can perform in both IOS and Android platform, however, mobile app in Java or Kotlin can only be launched in Android mobile and it need to be reprogrammed in swift in order to be available in IOS system.

Complexity of the App
As the native language, Java and Kotlin allow developer to build app that requires in-depth internal API’s call (e.g broadcast reverencers, sensors) and develop unique and complex apps.They can also access and use the build-in hardware and software such as location, storage and GPS. While, developers using Reactive Native do not have such direct access on the device and limit the complexity of the mobile app.

Reaction to the system update
In my opinion, the biggest drawback of React Native is its uncertainty on the Android update as it is hard to guarantee the mobile app will work on the next Android version. If React Native does not perform properly after the update, the developers have to pause and wait until Facebook fix such problem. As the native language, Java and Kotlin do not have such disadvantage.

Community support and online recourses
As the oldest programming language among these three, Java has the biggest community and most developers. Such resource enables Java developer to get help from others quicker and learn from online resources easier. Meanwhile, Kotlin and React Native released under 10 years, which have a relatively smaller community and the some help may be limited.

Choices for Android frontend development
XML
Java
React Native

Ease of development
I learned XML and Java a year ago and am familiar with how to make user interface with them. However, react native is quite new to me and is going to take time to learn. Personally, I prefer XML as the frontend technology as it is more efficient.

Efficiency for creating graphical interface
Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary and allows developers to use layout, then developers such as me can modify the interface while looking at the visual interface editor directly instead of code. Thus, developers can create interface efficiently and conveniently as they do not need to check with the tedious code. However, Java and React Native do not have this feature.

Responsive interface
FlexBox provided by React Native gives all the essential instruments for creating a responsive interface for the developer. Similarly, the Android’s constraint layout enables XML to do the same. Android also proves an amount of libraries and components for its official language — Java — to accomplish the responsive interface.

Complexity of the graphical interface
React Native does not provide enough amount of interface power for the highly complex UI or sophisticated animation. Similarly, XML does not have such capacity as well. Then Java will be the only available choice for the complex graphical interface and animation.

Bugs in the technology
Really Native is designed by Facebook and it does not fix bugs regularly unless they are relevant to the Facebook app. Then if a irrelevant bug occurs, developers will either fix by themselves or wait for the Facebook’s response. However, Java and XML are the supposed language by Android and they are updated regularly for the bugs.




CI/CD Choices
1. Jenkins
2. TravisCI
3. Github Action

Support 
Jenkins has no official support available or SLAs, however Github Action and TravisCI have community support or dedicated online interface. 

Parallelism
Jenkins allows build o be run in parallel but all builds share the same environments and can be issues from shared resources. Github action allows concurrent jobs even multi-platform and TravisCI allows developers to split build into different stages which are then run in parallel.



Container support
Jenkins runs all builds in the same environment by default as build server itself and leads to issues. GitHub Actions allows Linux, macOS, Windows and container run differently in a VM. TravisCI runs each build in isolated virtual machine.

Build pipelines
Jenkins offers extensive support for custom pipelines, either through the Jenkins Pipeline DSL or web UI. Github Action uses GitHub Action Workflows to Let developers to build pipelines. However, CircleCI specifically built around GitHub pull requests.

Ecosystem
There is a large community use Jenkins and Github Actions but not CircleCI.

Integration
They all support for the common tools like Slack notifications. Various VCS platforms etc.

DataBase Choices
SQLite
Txt file in internal Storage
MngoDB

Dataformat
DB use JSON documents, SQLite uses Tables and Txt file in internal storage follows text style.

Ease of Development
Since Android studio supports SQLite, SQLite is as easy as storing Tea file in the internal storage, While. MongoDB takes more time to implement.

Speed
All three are quite fast, but the SQLIte is the fastest one in my opinion.

Open Source
SQLite and MongoDB have open sources online, while storing using internal storage requires developers to search by themselves.

Server
MongoDB has MongoDB server, and SQLite and internal storage do not have any servers.
